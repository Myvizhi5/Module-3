# List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Pythonâ€™s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
``
numbers = [4, 7, 1, 3, 9]
total = sum(numbers)
print(total)
```

## Output
```
24
```
## Result
The program successfully calculates and prints the sum of all elements in the list using the built-in sum() function.
